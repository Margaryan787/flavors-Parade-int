            <h3>Apple pie</h3>
           <img src="images/Apple_pie.jpg" height="60px">
            <p>There are several theories about the origin of charlotte,most of which are associated with Great Britain.Apple pie was first mentioned in 1590 by American author Robert Greene.It is therefore assumed that this pie was first made in england.At that time,sugar was still an expensive ingredient so fruits  were most often used to sweeten pies. This  delicacy which Turgenev calls "Russian charlotte" was apparently popularized in the late 18th century by the French chef Marie-Antoine Careme.<h2>Ingredients and measurements </h2>Apples-3-4pcs(500-800g),Egg-2pcMilk-150g,Melt butter-50g,Sugar-70g+1-2tbsp,Vanila sugar-10g,Flour-200g(1glass with a capacity of 250ml)Baking powder-1heaped teaspoon,Salt-1/4teaspoon,Grated lemon zest(optional)-0.5-1teaspoon.Preparation instructions 1. The egg, milk and melted butter should be at room temperature. Add sugar, vanilla sugar and salt to the egg. Mix until light. 2. Add milk, half of the melted butter and lemon zest. 3. Mix flour with baking powder, add to the egg- milk mixture. Mix the dough until smooth. 4. Peel the apples (optional) and core them. Cut the apples into thin slices. 5. Pour the dough into a form pan lined with parchment paper. 6. Place apple slices vertically into the dough. The most delicious charlotte comes with caramelized apples. To do this, pieces of fruit are fried in a frying pan in sugar with a piece of butter. The more apples you use in the pie, the tastier it will be. 7. Sprinkle sugar on top (1-2 tablespoons) and pour over the remaining melted butter. 8. Bake the apple pie in the oven, preheated to 180 degrees, for 30-40 minutes. Check the readiness of the pie with a wooden skewer, it should come out without any raw dough left. Before removing the pie from the pan, let it cool for about 15minutes.<h3>Bon appetite to you</h3></p>
